Cheatsheet

This is a reference list of the most commonly used Git commands. (You might consider bookmarking this handy page.) Try to familiarize yourself with the commands so that you can eventually remember them all:

    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git or git clone https://github.com/user-name/repository-name.git ##obtain repository
        git push origin main ##push repository to main
    Commands related to workflow:
        git add . ##add filename to track individual file. or use "." to select everything in directory. use -a to track anything untracked in repository
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different" #commit currently tracked files, -m denotes message to submit with commit
    Commands related to checking status or log history
        git status ##check status of files tracked/untracked
        git log ##log of commits in session

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
